This is an attempt at cleaning up and resolving a bunch of issues that I've had
with the ZURB foundation. The original sources of which can be found at the
following locations:

  * http://foundation.zurb.com/
  * http://github.com/zurb/foundation

This was based off of version 3.0.9, and I will try and keep this as up to date
as possible with reason of the ZURB's version.

If you want to use this in a ruby project you'll need the following gems to compile the SCSS:

  * compass
  * modular-scale
  * sass
